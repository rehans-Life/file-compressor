Huffman Coding is a lossless data compression algorithm where variable length prefix codes are assigned to the characters used in the file. Prefix codes are those that won't form the prefix of any other code assigned to the other characters of the file. In Huffman Coding, these prefix codes (which are unique to each distinct character) are assinged in an efficient way such that the most frequently occuring character gets the smallest prefix code.
